# Reproducible Research Project

Runan Zhang & Jakub WnÄ™k, 2024

## The Goal To The Project 	

The goal of this repository is to replicate the market making trading strategy proposed in the paper "High-frequency trading in a limit order book" by Marco Avellaneda and Sasha Stoikov on a random walk stock price model. We aim to understand the behavior of stock prices in a high-frequency trading environment and validate our simulation model against the results provided in the paper.

## Set Up for Environment and Packages:

Packages used:
* python >= 3.9.6
* numpy >= 1.26.2
* matplotlib >= 3.8.2
* ipython >= 8.23.0
* pandas >= 2.2.1

One can use included requirements.txt file to recreate the environment ('pip install -r requirements.txt').
